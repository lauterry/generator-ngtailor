## ngTailor vs Yeoman generator-angular ?
Both aim to provide you a collection of tools and best practices to improve your productivity as a modern front end developer.
Yeoman generator-angular is great but in my opinion, it provides a bloated solution to manage and build angularjs applications.
ngTailor let you choose in a much more fine-grained way, each tools or components you want to be included in your application and workflow.
Note that ngTailor do not provide generator for directives, controllers etc like yeoman and generator-angular do.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
1. Install [node and npm](http://www.nodejs.org)
2. Install **yeoman** running `npm install -g yo`
3. If you are using npm below 1.2.10, run `npm install -g grunt-cli bower` to install **bower** and **grunt**
4. Install generator-ngtailor from npm running `npm install -g generator-ngtailor`

### Generate your Angular project
1. Create a new folder for your project
2. Open a terminal and run `yo ngtailor` in your project folder
3. Choose between "Fast mode" or "Advanced mode":
  * "Fast mode" : Generate an Angularjs project with the minimal options.
  * "Advanced mode" : Let you customize your scaffolding and add more features. Just answer to the prompted questions.
4. ngTailor will generate your Angularjs application and download all the dependencies by running ```npm install && bower install```
To check that everything is ok :
5. Run `grunt dev` to serve your static assets
6. Your should see "Yeahhh ! You're ready !" displayed in your browser
7. Voil√† ! Your Angular project is ready ! Next step is to discover the workflow ngtailor offers to you.


## Workflow
### Development
* Run `grunt dev` to start a static web server and open your browser.
* Livereload will be automatically active meaning that you can see your modification on the browser without hitting F5.
* `jshint` and/or `csslint` will be run on your files when they change.
* If you choose to have unit tests, they will be run as your test and source files change.

### Package for Production
* Run `grunt package` to package your static assets for production.
* Your package will be generated in a `dist` folder and your javascripts and stylesheets will be concatenated, minified and versionned.

### Available Grunt tasks
* `grunt ls` : list and describe the available grunt tasks of your project.
* `grunt test:unit` : run karma unit tests and show test coverage in console.
* `grunt test:e2e` : run karma e2e tests
* `grunt report` : open complexity report in your browser
* `grunt ci`: launch `grunt package`, run unit tests and e2e test and generate complexity report. Use this task for continuous integration.

## Update ngTailor
* `npm update -g generator-ngtailor`

## Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
